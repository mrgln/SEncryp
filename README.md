# SEncryp 1.0

A desktop program for text encryption made on C#

With this program, you can enter a specific text/open a text file and convert it to an encrypted version, using any key code that will affect the encryption method.

Also, this program decrypts the encrypted text using the same code. This final text can be saved to a separate file.

New encryption options will be added soon.
